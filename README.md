# orbDestruct 🎮

> My first Unreal Engine project – a physics sandbox where you launch metal spheres to mess with the environment.

## 🧩 Overview

**orbDestruct** is a simple physics-based prototype built with Unreal Engine 5.  
There are no weapons or characters — you control a floating camera and launch metal orbs by looking at any direction. These orbs push and scatter objects around using physics.

This project was created as my first hands-on attempt to learn Unreal Engine's basics: blueprint logic, physics interactions, input systems, and level design.
